# Spotify-Clone
As part of learning to code & frontend,I completed a project that involved creating a basic Spotify clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music. I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface, and implemented JavaScript to handle user input and interaction such as basic playback controls - play, pause, prev and next.
